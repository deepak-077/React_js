# React provides the functionality of components(jsx file)- the ability to run HTML from JavaScript 
Step1 - In \app.jsx we are returning a html function
Step2 - In main.jsx we are importing app.jsx

# React Components - Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
In ther words components return a html program

# component can return only one function. So in case we have to return more than 1 we just wrap them in div or empty tags
ex - 
return(<>
<p> ... </p>
<h1>... </h1>
</>)

# Or
return (<div>
<p> ... </p>
<h1>... </h1>
</div>)

# Main.jsx
.createRoot- It lets you create a root to display React components inside a browser DOM node

# Need of context api - to Pass data in an efficient manner.

we create a global file in which everything is declared and the element that wants to use the data can directly access from there, it doesn't need to be passed in every element

# UserContext will give us a provider as every context is a provider

we will make UserContext a wrapper 
like we make of fragments 
<UserContext>
<Login/>
<card/>
<UserContext/> 
now UserContext will become a provider- now every variable inside <UserContext> will have access to global UserContext line 3 of usercontext.js

# we can have also have direct access to components inside Usercontext

# context is a global variable
